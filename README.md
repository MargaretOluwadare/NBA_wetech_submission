This repo contains submissions from Wetech mentee

# Challenges to solve
1. Using the information and data provided below, develop a model that would predict the teams that would qualify for the 2022-2023 NBA PLAYOFFS from both the East and West conferences and the eventual winners of each conference and the NBA finals.

2. Create a fictional team of 15 players chosen randomly from the available players and predict the outcome of your fictional team for the 2022-2023 NBA season.

3. Explain your choice of model and assumptions and make adequate use of comments to explain variables, functions, and overall algorithms and work.

## NOTE:

1. The winners from each conference play against each other in the NBA finals which is a best-of-7 games series like other playoff series.

2. The NBA teams https://www.nba.com/teams are organized in conferences as such: Atlantic, Central, and South East teams are in the Eastern Conference while Northwest, Pacific, and Southwest teams are in the Western Conference.
